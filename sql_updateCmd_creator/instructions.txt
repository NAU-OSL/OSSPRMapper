This script uses CSVs containing general-expert classification mappings to produce SQL commands that will redefine
database entries to match the redefinitions in the aforemention input CSVs. 

It is set, at the moment, to append to the output file, allowing multiple runs of the program to output all of the
commands to one file. Adjust that as needed in the function write_sql(). To define which columns of the input CSV
to pay attention to, look at the first loop in create_cmd_str().

The two inputs that we are using as of 06/25/2021 are in the inputs folder as of the time of writing, but can also
be found here:
